# CLAUDE.md — urlx / liburlx

## Project Identity

**urlx** is a memory-safe Rust reimplementation of curl and libcurl. The project produces three artifacts:

- `liburlx` — An idiomatic Rust transfer library (the core)
- `liburlx-ffi` — A C ABI compatibility layer that is a drop-in replacement for libcurl
- `urlx` — A command-line tool that is a drop-in replacement for the `curl` command

The project is MIT-licensed. The name "urlx" stands for "URL transfer."

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0 — Cumulative Summary (Phases 1-59)

**What has been built:** A functional curl replacement covering HTTP/1.0-1.1, HTTP/2 (with ALPN, multiplexing, connection pooling, server push), HTTP/3 (QUIC via quinn), TLS (rustls + native-tls), FTP/FTPS (full session, active mode, MLST/MLSD, resume), SSH/SFTP/SCP, WebSocket (RFC 6455 + permessage-deflate), MQTT (QoS 0/1/2), SMTP, IMAP, POP3, DICT, TFTP, file://, DNS (system + hickory + DoH + DoT + Happy Eyeballs), cookies (Netscape format, domain-indexed, PSL, SameSite), HSTS (persistence), proxies (HTTP/SOCKS4/SOCKS4a/SOCKS5/HTTPS tunnel), authentication (Basic, Digest, Bearer, AWS SigV4, NTLMv2, SCRAM-SHA-256), connection pooling, rate limiting, multipart form upload, decompression (gzip, deflate, br, zstd), and a C ABI compatibility layer (liburlx-ffi).

**Key stats (Phase 60 audit):**
- Tests: 2,515
- CLI flags: ~199 long + 36 short (curl has ~250 long flags)
- FFI: 119 unique CURLOPT, 47 CURLINFO, 42 CURLcode, 56 exported functions, C test harness
- Benchmark suite: 9 groups (URL parsing, cookies, HSTS, DNS, headers, HTTP parsing, multipart)
- Feature flags: 20+ (http, http2, http3, ftp, ssh, ws, mqtt, smtp, imap, pop3, etc.)
- 4 fuzz harnesses (URL, HTTP, cookie, HSTS)

**Phases 52-59 summary:** CLI drop-in essentials (--help, --version, combined short flags, h2 stream fix), protocol dispatch for all schemes, HTTP/2 robustness (pooling, chunked upload, push), FFI hardening (145 CURLOPT, blob certs, protocol restriction), authentication completeness (NTLMv2, SCRAM-SHA-256, SameSite), protocol polish (WS deflate, MQTT QoS, SFTP symlinks, TFTP errors), Criterion benchmarks with optimization, and CLI completeness (~199 long flags, conditional requests, retry logic).

### Phase 60 — Comprehensive Review (In Progress)

Milestone review phase. Audit results:

**FFI Coverage:**
- 119 unique CURLOPT options in enum (curl has ~300)
- 47 unique CURLINFO options (curl has ~60)
- 42 CURLcode error codes (curl has ~99)
- 56 no_mangle exported functions (curl has ~80)
- C test harness: 11 tests

**CLI Coverage:**
- 199 unique long flags + 36 short flags
- curl has ~250 long flags → ~80% coverage
- Missing: man page generation, ~50 low-frequency flags

**Known Gaps:**
- WebSocket not dispatched from Easy API (needs high-level handler)
- HTTP/3 untested (needs quinn test server)
- SCRAM-SHA-256 not wired to SMTP/IMAP/POP3
- `curl_easy_pause()` is a no-op stub
- No C test harness for FFI
- LDAP, RTSP, Kerberos/Negotiate not implemented
- PAC proxy auto-configuration not implemented

### Phase 61 — WS Dispatch & Protocol Auth (Completed 2026-03-10)

Wired ws:// and wss:// scheme dispatch in `do_single_request` via new `ws::connect()` function. The connect handler performs TCP connection (plain for ws://, TLS via `TlsConnector::new_no_alpn` for wss://), sends HTTP upgrade request with Sec-WebSocket-Key, validates Sec-WebSocket-Accept in response, returns Response with 101 status. Added `parse_upgrade_response()` helper. 4 new tests (parse_upgrade_response 101/403/invalid_accept, ws_connect_mock_server). HTTP/3 testing and SCRAM-SHA-256 wiring deferred to Phase 62.

### Phase 62 — FFI Parity Push (Completed 2026-03-10)

Added 17 new CURLOPT options (PORT, INFILESIZE, RESUME_FROM, PROXYPORT, FILETIME, BUFFERSIZE, PROXYTYPE, IPRESOLVE, FTP_FILEMETHOD, SOCKS5_AUTH, POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE, CAPATH, MAXCONNECTS, PIPEWAIT, STREAM_WEIGHT, TCP_FASTOPEN, HTTP09_ALLOWED), 4 CURLINFO getters (REQUEST_SIZE, HTTP_CONNECTCODE, HTTPAUTH_AVAIL, PROXYAUTH_AVAIL), 10 CURLcode error variants. Created C test harness (11 tests covering init/cleanup, setopt, duphandle, reset, strerror, version, pause, slist, URL API, getinfo). 20 new Rust tests. SCRAM-SHA-256 SMTP wiring deferred to Phase 64.

### Phase 63 — CLI Flag Parity

- Implement remaining ~50 curl flags (prioritized by usage frequency)
- Man page generation from CLI flag definitions
- Combined short flags edge cases
- Config file improvements (support for all flags)

### Phase 64 — Error Handling & Diagnostics

- Wire SCRAM-SHA-256 to SMTP AUTH (multi-step AUTHENTICATE exchange)
- Improve error messages to match curl's format
- Add --trace/--trace-ascii output formatting parity
- Verbose output parity with curl's connection info
- Better error codes (map to CURLcode values)

### Phase 65 — Connection & Transfer Polish

- HTTP/2 stream priority (wiring, not just storing)
- Connection pool TTL and cleanup
- Happy Eyeballs improvements
- Transfer resume improvements across protocols

### Phase 66 — Security Hardening

- Kerberos/Negotiate authentication
- Certificate revocation checking (CRL, OCSP)
- Improved certificate pinning (multiple pins)
- HSTS preload list support

### Phase 67 — Protocol Extensions

- LDAP protocol handler (basic search)
- RTSP protocol handler (basic playback)
- MQTT improvements (will messages, retained)
- FTP improvements (SITE commands, STAT)

### Phase 68 — Performance Optimization

- Profile and optimize hot paths identified in Phase 58 benchmarks
- HTTP/2 multiplexing performance
- Connection pool efficiency
- Memory usage reduction

### Phase 69 — Documentation & Distribution

- Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- Man page generation
- Package for more distributions (apt, dnf, etc.)
- Benchmark comparison vs curl published in README

### Phase 70 — Comprehensive Review

Milestone review phase. Audit full codebase, differential testing, plan phases 71-80.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Test-driven development is non-negotiable.** Every feature begins with a failing test. No code is merged without tests. Integration tests run against real protocol servers.
2. **Zero `unsafe` outside of `liburlx-ffi`.** The core library and CLI must be 100% safe Rust. All `unsafe` is confined to the FFI boundary in `liburlx-ffi` and must have `// SAFETY:` comments.
3. **Correctness over performance.** Get the behavior right first. Optimize later with benchmarks proving the need.
4. **Behavioral compatibility with curl.** When in doubt about how something should work, match curl's behavior. curl's test suite is the specification.
5. **Feature flags for optional functionality.** Each protocol, TLS backend, and optional feature is behind a Cargo feature flag. The default feature set covers HTTP/HTTPS. Minimal builds must be possible.
6. **Conventional commits.** Every commit message must follow the Conventional Commits specification. This is enforced by CI.
7. **This file is a living document.** CLAUDE.md is the project's source of truth. As work is completed, remove finished sections and add new plans for upcoming work. The file should always reflect the current state and next steps — never stale.

## Code Style & Conventions

### Error Handling

- Use `thiserror` for error type derivation.
- All public functions return `Result<T, UrlxError>`.
- Error types must be non-exhaustive (`#[non_exhaustive]`) to allow future additions.
- Never panic. Never `unwrap()` in library code. The `unwrap_used` clippy lint is denied.
- In test code, `unwrap()` and `expect()` are fine.

### Naming Conventions

- Crate names: `liburlx`, `liburlx-ffi`, `urlx-cli`
- Module names: `snake_case`
- Types: `PascalCase`
- Functions: `snake_case`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Feature flags: `kebab-case` (e.g., `http2`, `ftp`, `rustls`, `native-tls`)

### Documentation

- Every public item must have a doc comment.
- Every module must have a module-level doc comment explaining its purpose.
- Examples in doc comments must compile (enforced by `cargo test --doc`).
- Use `#![warn(missing_docs)]` in all crate roots.

### Async Architecture

The core is async (tokio). The Easy API provides a sync wrapper via `tokio::runtime::Builder::new_current_thread()`. The Multi API is native async.

### Feature Flags

Default features: `http`, `rustls`, `cookies`, `decompression`. Optional: `http2`, `http3`, `ftp`, `mqtt`, `ws`, `smtp`, `imap`, `pop3`, `ssh`, `file`, `hsts`, `dns-over-https`, `socks`, `hickory-dns`, `native-tls`.

## Test-Driven Development Protocol

### The TDD Cycle for Every Feature

1. **Write the test first.** The test must fail (or not compile) before any implementation.
2. **Write the minimum code to pass.** No speculative features.
3. **Refactor.** Clean up while all tests still pass.
4. **Verify guardrails.** `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`, `cargo doc` must all pass.

### Test Categories

- **Unit tests:** In-crate `#[cfg(test)]` modules. Run with `cargo test --lib`.
- **Integration tests:** `tests/` directory, against real servers (hyper/tokio on random ports). Run with `cargo test --test '*'`.
- **Property-based:** `proptest` for parser correctness (URL, cookie, HSTS, WebSocket, FTP, multipart).
- **Fuzz harnesses:** 4 cargo-fuzz harnesses in `fuzz/`.
- **FFI tests:** C-language test programs linking against liburlx-ffi.

### Coverage Requirements

- **Unit test coverage target: 80%+** for all crates. Measured by `cargo-tarpaulin`.
- **Integration test coverage: every public API function** must be exercised.
- **Every bug fix must include a regression test** that would have caught it.

## Agent Instructions

When working on this project:

### Guardrails

1. **Always check guardrails after every change.** Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, `cargo doc` after every meaningful code change. Fix issues immediately. Do not proceed with broken guardrails.

2. **Never suppress warnings.** If clippy or the compiler warns about something, fix it properly. The only allowed suppressions are targeted `#[allow(...)]` with a comment explaining why.

### Test-Driven Development

3. **Write the test before the implementation.** If you find yourself writing implementation code without a corresponding test, stop and write the test first.

4. **Every bug fix must include a regression test** that would have caught it.

### Commits

5. **Use conventional commits for every commit.** Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`. Never commit with a freeform message. Examples:
   - `feat(http): add chunked transfer encoding`
   - `test(url): add edge case tests for IDN domains`
   - `fix(cookie): match curl behavior for expired cookie cleanup`
   - `chore: update dependencies`
   - `docs: update CLAUDE.md — mark Phase 1 complete`

6. **Commit atomically.** Each commit should be one logical change with one type. If a commit needs both `feat` and `test`, split it into `test(...): add tests for X` followed by `feat(...): implement X`. The test commit comes first.

7. **Scope names** must match crate or module names: `http`, `ftp`, `tls`, `url`, `cookie`, `dns`, `proxy`, `auth`, `ffi`, `cli`, `pool`, `filter`, `ws`, `mqtt`, `smtp`, `imap`. Use no scope for cross-cutting changes.

### Maintaining CLAUDE.md

8. **This file is a living document. Update it as you work.** CLAUDE.md must always reflect the current state of the project and the immediate next steps. Specifically:

   - **When a phase is fully complete,** collapse its detailed steps into a brief "Completed" summary. Do not leave stale instructions.

   - **When starting a new phase,** expand it with detailed, actionable implementation steps. Future phases should remain as brief outlines until they become current.

   - **When plans change,** update this file immediately.

   - **Update the Current Status section** with every phase transition.

   - **Record decisions in the Decision Log** when significant architectural or design choices are made.

### Milestone Review Phases

9. **Every 10th phase (10, 20, 30, ...) must be a comprehensive review.** These phases are dedicated to auditing the entire codebase against curl/libcurl for completeness, running differential tests, measuring FFI coverage, profiling performance, and planning the next 10 phases. No new features are added during review phases — only testing, gap analysis, and planning. **During review phases, compact the phase list:** merge all completed phases from the prior 10-phase block into the existing "Phase 0" summary (or create one if it doesn't exist). Phase 0 should describe the current state of the repo — what has been built, key stats, and architectural decisions. After compaction, the Implementation Phases section should contain only Phase 0 (cumulative summary of all completed work) followed by the next 10 planned phases (brief outlines of future work). This keeps CLAUDE.md concise and avoids unbounded growth.

### Behavioral Correctness

10. **When stuck on behavior, check curl.** Clone curl's repo and examine the relevant source file. curl's behavior is the specification. When curl's behavior seems wrong, document it and match it anyway (with a comment noting the curl compat quirk and a link to the relevant curl source).

11. **Keep the scope tight.** Implement the minimum for the current phase. Do not speculatively add protocols or features ahead of schedule.

### Protocol Implementation Checklist

12. **When implementing a protocol handler,** follow this order:
    a. Write integration tests with a mock server
    b. Define the protocol-specific error variants
    c. Implement the happy path
    d. Add error handling for each failure mode (with tests)
    e. Add edge case handling (with tests)
    f. Run clippy, fmt, doc
    g. Add a fuzz harness for any parser
    h. Commit: `test(<proto>): add tests for <feature>` then `feat(<proto>): implement <feature>`

### FFI Safety

13. **For the FFI layer,** every `#[no_mangle] pub extern "C" fn` must have:
    - A `// SAFETY:` comment on every `unsafe` block
    - Null pointer checks on all pointer arguments
    - Proper error code returns (never panic across FFI boundary)
    - A corresponding C test program that exercises it
    - A catch_unwind wrapper to prevent Rust panics from unwinding into C
